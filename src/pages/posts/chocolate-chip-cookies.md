## Tips for Perfect Cookies

- **Room temperature ingredients**: Make sure your butter and eggs are at room temperature for the best texture.
- **Don't overmix**: Mix the dough just until the flour disappears to keep cookies tender.
- **Chill the dough**: For thicker cookies, refrigerate the dough for 30 minutes before baking.
- **Use quality chocolate**: Good chocolate chips make a huge difference in flavor!

## Variations

Try these fun variations:
- **Double Chocolate**: Replace 1/4 cup flour with cocoa powder
- **Peanut Butter**: Add 1/2 cup peanut butter chips
- **Sea Salt**: Sprinkle flaky sea salt on top before baking
- **Oatmeal**: Replace 1 cup flour with rolled oats

As someone who loves playing the violin, I spend a lot of time playing different violin repertoire, 
often they are concerti, even if I am just merely attempting them for pleasure rather than the 
goal of being able to perform them. I also spend a lot of my time listening to them, as it is one of my
favourite forms of music.

This post contains a list of my favorite movements from various concerti. Most are for violin 
since that's what I know best, but I've included others that I love just as much. 

I'll keep adding to this list as I discover new favorites

1. Tchaikovsky Violin Concerto in D major
    This has to be first on my list. It has been my favourite violin concerto and I never get bored of listening to it. For this reason, I would recommend listening to the whole piece.
2. Mozart Violin Concerto No. 5 III. Rondeau
3. Dvorak Violin Concerto in A minor I. Allegro ma non troppo
4. Elgar Cello Concerto in E minor I. Adagio - Moderato
5. Prokofiev Violin Concerto No. 1 II. Scherzo: vivacissimo & III. Moderato - Allegro moderato
6. Prokofiev Violin Concerto No. 2 I. Allegro moderato & III. Allegro, ben marcato
7. Mozart Violin Concerto No. 4
    My favourite Mozart violin concerto.
8. Wienawski Violin Concerto No. 1 I. Allegro moderato
9. Wienawski Violin Concerto No. 2 II. Andante non troppo
10. Butterfly Lovers Violin Concerto I. Adagio cantabile
11. Rachmaninoff Rhapsody on a Theme by Paganini
12. Saint-Saens Cello Concerto No. 1
    The whole thing is fantastic and beautiful.
13. Dvorak Cello Concerto in B minor I. Allegro
14. Sibelius Violin Concerto in D minor
    At least my 2nd favourite violin concerto, a MUST listen.
15. Korngold Violin Concerto in D major
    Again, the whole thing is magical.
16. Brahms Double Concerto for Violin and Cello in A minor III. Vivace non troppo
